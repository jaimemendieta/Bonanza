                    <h2>What is EMDR Therapy?</h2>
                    <p>
                        EMDR, or Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing, is a powerful therapeutic technique
                        developed to aid individuals in processing traumatic memories and adverse life experiences.
                        At its core, EMDR is designed to help clients integrate and understand these memories,
                        ultimately reducing their emotional charge.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div className="explanation">
                    <h3>How Does It Work?</h3>
                    <p>
                        EMDR utilizes structured eight-phase therapy involving bilateral stimulation, often through
                        guided eye movements. This process helps the brain reprocess traumatic memories,
                        transforming them into more manageable, neutral memories.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div className="explanation">
                    <h3>Benefits of EMDR Include:</h3>
                    <p>
                        Rapid processing of traumatic experiences. <br/>
                        Decreased distress from disturbing memories. <br/>
                        Improved self-esteem and self-worth. <br/>
                        Enhanced ability to live in the present without being overshadowed by the past. <br/>
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div className="explanation">

                                            Now button to complete and send the form. Email certainly works - but if
                                            you include your phone number on the form - it is easier to answer all of
                                            your questions, and book your first session. Physician or specialist
                                            referral is not required.
